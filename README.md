The purpose of this site is to compare prices for various video game consoles for the convenience of the consumer.

One page shows official release trailers for PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, one page has contact information, and one page has an "About" description.

The site features embedded videos, a table, a footer, and a black background.

For the design decisions, I thought that simple is best.

One problem I had was figuring out how to get the background from an image to plain black. I was able to fix it.
